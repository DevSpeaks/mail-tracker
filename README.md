# Mail Tracker

A simple Node.js + Express + EJS + SQLite application that generates and serves 1×1 tracking pixels for email opens. This project lets you:

- Create unique tracking pixel URLs.
- Embed them in emails (or web pages) to record open events.
- View open logs with timestamps, IPs, and user agents.

## Features

1. **Pixel Generation**  
   - Generates a unique ID (UUID) for each pixel.  
   - Stores pixel data (name, creation time) in a local SQLite database.

2. **Open Tracking**  
   - Serves a 1×1 transparent PNG at `/tracker/:id.png`.  
   - Logs each open event (time, IP, user-agent) to SQLite.

3. **Web Dashboard**  
   - Displays all created pixels.  
   - Provides a “View Logs” page to see open events for each pixel.  
   - Includes instructions on how to embed pixels in Gmail emails.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the ZIP):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevSpeaks/mail-tracker.git
   cd mail-tracker
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   By default, it listens on port `3300`. You can visit <http://localhost:3300> in your browser.


## Usage

1. **Open the dashboard**  
   Go to <http://localhost:3300> in your browser.  

2. **Create a pixel**  
   - Enter a pixel name (optional) and click **Create Pixel**.  
   - A new pixel entry appears with a unique Tracker URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3300/tracker/<UUID>.png`).

3. **Embed the pixel**  
   - Copy the Tracker URL.  
   - Insert it into an email as an `<img>` tag or using Gmail’s “Insert photo from web” option.  
   - Once the recipient opens the email (and images load), your server records an open event.

4. **View logs**  
   - Click the **View Logs** link next to a pixel on the dashboard.  
   - You’ll see each open event with date/time, IP address, and user-agent.

## Important Notes

1. **Localhost vs. Public Domain**  
   - If you’re running this on your local machine (`http://localhost:3000`), external email clients won’t be able to load the pixel.  
   - You need a **publicly accessible** domain or IP address (e.g., on a VPS, Heroku, Render, etc.) for real-world tracking.

2. **Image Blocking**  
   - Many email clients (including Gmail) block or proxy images by default.  
   - Not all opens will be recorded if the recipient doesn’t enable images.

3. **Privacy & Legal**  
   - Depending on your region, you may be required to disclose to recipients that you’re tracking email opens.  
   - Use responsibly and comply with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).

## Embedding in Gmail (Quick Guide)

1. **Copy** the Tracker URL from your dashboard (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com/tracker/<UUID>.png`).  
2. **Compose a new email** in Gmail.  
3. **Click** the “Insert photo” icon in the formatting toolbar.  
4. **Select** “Web Address (URL)” and paste your pixel URL.  
5. **Insert** the image. It might look like a tiny/broken icon—this is normal for a 1×1 transparent pixel.  
6. **Send** the email. Once opened (with images enabled), the pixel is requested, and your open log updates.
